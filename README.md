# Is Disneyland open yet?

A web page for quickly answering that all-important question.

## But why?

The idea for this came out of the desire to do something creative/productive to justify my incessant news checking. This is what happened. Don’t take it too seriously.

It was also a chance to play with some technologies I’m interested in.

## Technologies used
